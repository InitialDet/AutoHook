## Features
- Conditional hooking based on your current bait/mooch
- Configurable Max/Min wait time before hooking
- Conditional hooking while under the effect of Fisher's intuition
- Auto Cast Line, Auto Mooch, Auto Cordial, and much more.
- Auto Spearfishing

## Default Cast and Default Mooch
As the name suggests, this is the default behavior when using Cast/Mooch if you don't have a custom configuration for a bait/mooched fish. That means if you select only to hook Weak Tugs (!), all !! or !!! tugs will be ignored no matter the bait or fish being mooched. 

### IMPORTANT 
Custom configurations have priority over the default config.
For example, if you have a custom config for 'Versatile Lure', the default behavior will be ignored when using 'Versatile Lure' as bait. Simple right? (right???).

## Custom Bait/Mooch
In this tab, you can customize which hook to use based on your current bait or fish being mooched. For example, this is my configuration to catch an 'Imperial Goldfish'
- If my bait is 'Honey Worm', only hook Weak Tugs (!).
- If I catch a Silverfish, mooch it, and only hook Weak Tugs (!). But if under the effect of Fisher's Intuition, hook Legendary Tugs (!!!) and ignore !/!!.
- If I catch a Goldfish, mooch it, and only hook Strong Tugs (!!). (This is to catch 3 Jungle Catfish for the Intuition buff).
